# CAN-GRAIN Project

## Organization Description


## Project Description

[UPOV website](https://www.upov.int/portal/index.html.en)

GRAIN asked me to do an analysis of the effects of joining UPOV on agricultural yields. They have a dataset of when countries joined UPOV and FAO has data on production and acres planted by country, year, and crop. You can do an analysis of the change in yields in neighboring countries after a country joins

when they asked me it was specifically for an article they were publishing with a very quick turnaround time so I didn't get them anything too rigorous. I'm sure they would be interested in a more rigorous analysis (but aren't relying on one if the class doesn't produce it)


## Expected Deliverables



## Working with the data

This repository only contains the data for use by this project. Both of the datasets are saved as comma separated files and can be read by any analysis tool which opens standard CSV.
